# Realtime EventHub

Excited to share **Realtime EventHub** – a real-time college event management system designed to revolutionize event organization and management! 🎉 While it's not hosted yet, the project is fully developed and ready for deployment.

## ✨ Why Realtime EventHub Stands Out:

1. **Instant Real-Time Updates** 🚀  
   - Stay updated the moment a new event is created or modified with real-time notifications powered by **WebSockets**.

2. **AI-Powered Chatbot** 🤖  
   - Get instant answers to event-related queries, from schedules to registrations, using our **smart chatbot**.

3. **Security & Authentication** 🔒  
   - Secure authentication using **JWT tokens, Passport.js, Google OAuth, and OTP verification** ensures data safety.

4. **Automated Email Notifications** 📩  
   - Never miss an update – receive email alerts for event creation, registrations, and more.

5. **Admin Control Hub** 🛠️  
   - A powerful dashboard for admins to **approve, edit, and assign events** effortlessly.

6. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** 👥  
   - Different user experiences for **students, faculty, event managers, and admins**.

7. **Effortless Database Management** 📊  
   - Uses **Sequelize ORM with migrations** to manage schema changes and version control smoothly.

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 🛢️
- **ORM:** Sequelize (with migrations) 🗂️
- **Real-Time:** WebSockets 🔄
- **Authentication:** JWT, Passport.js, Google OAuth, OTP 🔑
- **Notifications:** Email + WebSocket-based 📬
